# Welcome, Contributors! ðŸ˜„

Thank you so much for your interest in contributing to Install C. We accept contributions in (but not limited to) the following categories:
* Code
* Documentation
* Financial
* Design
* Ideas, Planning, and Feedback
* Research
* Translation

## Code
The source code is stored in this file: [Cinstaller1.iss](Cinstaller1.iss). Everything else in this repository is just a supporting file. Cinstaller1.iss is the only file used to generate the Install C installer.

Pre-requisites:
* [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) - Inno Setup is a free installer for Windows programs by Jordan Russell and Martijn Laan. First introduced in 1997, Inno Setup today rivals and even surpasses many commercial installers in feature set and stability.
  Install C uses Inno Setup to generate its installer. An installer is generated using instructions found in the [Cinstaller1.iss](Cinstaller1.iss) file.

* [WinLibs](https://winlibs.com/) - WinLibs is a standalone build of GCC and MinGW-w64 for Windows. It also includes useful tools like GDB, GNU Binutils, and GNU Make. Install C uses WinLibs as its source for executables. Download the version on WinLibs as written in the [Readme](README.MD) and correct the path in the [Cinstaller1.iss](Cinstaller1.iss) file to lead to it.

## Documentation

Install C's Documentation is located at https://installc.org/learn. The docs are written and stored in .md (Markdown) format. For now, if you want to improve the docs, open a discussion on the [Discussions](https://github.com/Welding-Torch/installc/discussions) page. 

## Financial

Thank you for the interest, but I'm not accepting donations right now. Maybe in the future...

## Design

Design is the most vital aspect of Install C. Our goal is to make Install C very modern, user-friendly, and beginner-friendly. The design of Install C makes a huge impact on all of this. If you want to improve the design of the installer, the README, or this repository; fork this repository, make your ideal changes, and submit a pull request. If you want to improve the design of the website, send me an email with your ideal changes at siddharth@installc.org (this is temporary until the site repo becomes more organized). 

## Ideas, Planning, and Feedback

How can we make Install C Better? What should the roadmap for Install C look like? What do you think about Install C? You can help us answer all of these questions. Share your thoughts on the [Discussions](https://github.com/Welding-Torch/installc/discussions) page.

## Research

Research into the technical aspects of C Programming is required. This research should be related to improving Install C in some way. Share your insights on the [Discussions](https://github.com/Welding-Torch/installc/discussions) page.

## Translation

Translate Install C into your language by editing the [Readme](README.MD).
